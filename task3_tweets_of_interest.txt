I honestly believe ladies should have as much respect for their husbands as husbands for their wives
It's amazing how often men interpret women's anger (at anything, but esp. at sexism) to be evidence of unreason, rather than of a problem
I honestly believe ladies should have more respect for their husbands than husbands for their wives
I'm really not sexist, but most women can't drive for shit!!
When you encounter "patriarchy hurts men too!":
woman suck at driving, period.

honestly women can't drive as well as men.
men are much better than women, like srsly.
but they have to follow, not lead. women know the issues they face better than men. listening is important.
you actually believe that as many women force men into having sex as the opposite you're delusional
If you use the word "females" as a man to refer to women you are bad in bed. Fact.
Nothing like a man fine women with pretty feet in a great pair of shoes!
Repeatedly calling a woman a bitch from the stage was just part of the Crunchies' problems with women
I firmly believe woman should ALWAYS smell good, at work, at the gym, Anywhere

I loathe how women still expect men to open doors and give up seats for them, yet in the next breath demand 'equality'
the world went downhill when women started thinking they could do men's roles
Call me sexist, but if you need a specific training segment for coaching women, it defeats the purpose of equality across the board...
